# $\LaTeX$ Lecture Notes Template

Simple lecture notes template with colored boxes, focused on Mathematics.

Box definitions and shortcuts are stored in [`boxes.sty`](packages/boxes.sty) and [`general.sty`](packages/general.sty) respectively.

Includes boxes for Theorems, Propositions, Corollaries (with proofs), and Definitions and Examples.

Also in the repository is [`Lecture Notes Template.tex`](Lecture%20Notes%20Template.tex) containing use cases for all the environments, and some of the shortcuts.

Can be used in VSCode by installing the [`LaTeX Workshop`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension.
